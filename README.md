# Descrition
Welcome,
This is the web version of a mobile app intended for church communities. It is currently a work in progress, but feel free to look at the progress. The goal of this project is to allow Christians to share prayer requests so they can grow into their community. This will be the first project I expect to be used by multiple people on a daily bases. Debugging will be very crucial aspect, so the users don't get frustrated. Through this project I hope to bring my community closer as one body and provide a quality real world project to include on my portfolio.
